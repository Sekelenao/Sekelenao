  ![Spring](https://img.shields.io/badge/Spring-6DB33F?style=for-the-badge&logo=spring&logoColor=white)
  ![SpringSec](https://img.shields.io/badge/Spring_Security-6DB33F?style=for-the-badge&logo=Spring-Security&logoColor=white)
  ![Hibernate](https://img.shields.io/badge/Hibernate-59666C?style=for-the-badge&logo=Hibernate&logoColor=white)

  Java is by far the technology I master the most because I had the opportunity to learn from recognized experts in this language. The areas I have covered include:

  - Full-stack development using Spring and ORM
  - Implementation of complex data structures
  - Concurrency and vectorization
  - Design patterns
  - JDBC connectors (PostgreSQL, Redis, Oracle DB)
  - Kafka library

  ![Angular](https://img.shields.io/badge/Angular-DD0031?style=for-the-badge&logo=angular&logoColor=white)
  ![Vue](https://img.shields.io/badge/Vue.js-35495E?style=for-the-badge&logo=vue.js&logoColor=4FC08D)
  ![Ts](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-007ACC?style=for-the-badge&logo=typescript&logoColor=white)

  I have worked with these languages and frameworks as part of my full-stack development in Java. Angular and TypeScript are my favorite technologies, and the ones I have the most experience with. I often use TypeScript with object-oriented programming (yes, you might have guessed).

  ![Psql](https://img.shields.io/badge/PostgreSQL-316192?style=for-the-badge&logo=postgresql&logoColor=white)
  ![Mongodb](https://img.shields.io/badge/MongoDB-4EA94B?style=for-the-badge&logo=mongodb&logoColor=white)
  ![Oracle](https://img.shields.io/badge/Oracle-F80000?style=for-the-badge&logo=oracle&logoColor=black)
  ![Neo4j](https://img.shields.io/badge/Neo4j-018bff?style=for-the-badge&logo=neo4j&logoColor=white)
  ![Redis](https://img.shields.io/badge/redis-%23DD0031.svg?&style=for-the-badge&logo=redis&logoColor=white)
  ![Spark](https://img.shields.io/badge/Apache%20Spark-E25A1C.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=Apache-Spark&logoColor=white)
  ![Gql](https://img.shields.io/badge/GraphQL-E10098.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=GraphQL&logoColor=white)

  During my studies, I extensively worked with PostgreSQL and all its functionalities, as well as NoSQL databases, Apache Spark, Cypher, Redis, and Kafka. Additionally, I used OracleDB during my professional experience.
  
  ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3776AB?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=white)
  ![Tf](https://img.shields.io/badge/TensorFlow-FF6F00?style=for-the-badge&logo=tensorflow&logoColor=white)
  
  During my studies and free time, I had the opportunity to extensively work with Python for various tasks and domains:
  
  - Data Science: neural networks, dataframes, data formatting.
  - OOP: game development, application of filters on images using C libraries.
  - Office Automation: automating repetitive tasks.

  ![C](https://img.shields.io/badge/C-00599C?style=for-the-badge&logo=c&logoColor=white)
  ![Cpp](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%2B%2B-00599C?style=for-the-badge&logo=c%2B%2B&logoColor=white)

  I studied C and computer architecture for 3 years. This provided me with a very precise understanding of what happens in the machine with each code instruction, regardless of the language. I only delved into C++ for 6 months, acquiring fundamentals such as ownership and standard libraries.

  ![Debian](https://img.shields.io/badge/Debian-A81D33?style=for-the-badge&logo=debian&logoColor=white)
  ![Git](https://img.shields.io/badge/GIT-E44C30?style=for-the-badge&logo=git&logoColor=white)
  
  To program on my free time.
