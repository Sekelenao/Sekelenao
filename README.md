  I always use Debian for programming in my free time. I also have knowledge of other Linux distributions due to professional experience where I had to handle Linux servers.

  During my studies and free time, I had the opportunity to extensively work with Python for various tasks and domains:
    - Data Science: neural networks, dataframes, data formatting.
    - OOP: game development, application of filters on images using C libraries.
    - Office Automation: automating repetitive tasks.
