  Java is by far the technology I master the most because I had the opportunity to learn from recognized experts in this language. The areas I have covered include:

  - Full-stack development using Spring (and briefly Quarkus)
  - Implementation of complex data structures
  - Concurrency and vectorization
  - Design patterns
  - JDBC connectors (PostgreSQL, Redis, Oracle DB)
  - Kafka library

  During my studies and free time, I had the opportunity to extensively work with Python for various tasks and domains:
  
  - Data Science: neural networks, dataframes, data formatting.
  - OOP: game development, application of filters on images using C libraries.
  - Office Automation: automating repetitive tasks.

  I always use Debian for programming in my free time. I also have knowledge of other Linux distributions due to professional experience where I had to handle Linux servers.
