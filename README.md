Hi ! My name is Yohann, I'm born in 1999 and I'm a french fan of OOP. I earned a Master degree in Software and Data Engineering. Always looking for new challenges and opportunities.

<h2 align="center"> Main technologies </h2>

  Java is the technology in which I possess the highest level of expertise, a proficiency acquired through learning from esteemed experts in the field. The areas I have delved into include :

  - Full-stack development using Spring and ORM
  - Implementation of complex data structures
  - Concurrency and vectorization
  - Design patterns
  - JDBC connectors (PostgreSQL, Redis, Oracle DB)
  - Kafka library

</h2>

  I have worked with these languages and frameworks as part of my full-stack development in Java. Angular and TypeScript are my favorite technologies, and the ones I have the most experience with. I often use TypeScript with object-oriented programming (yes, you might have guessed).

  During my studies, I extensively worked with PostgreSQL and all its functionalities, as well as Apache Spark, Cypher, Redis, and Kafka. Additionally, I used OracleDB during my professional experience.

  During my studies and free time, I had the opportunity to extensively work with Python for various tasks and domains:
  
  - Data Science: neural networks, dataframes, data formatting.
  - OOP: game development, application of filters on images using C libraries.
  - Office Automation: automating repetitive tasks.

  I studied C and computer architecture for 3 years. This provided me with a very precise understanding of what happens in the machine with each code instruction, regardless of the language.
